## 📐 Design and Architecture<a name="design-and-architecture">

The Full Stack Test FE project adopts a modular, component-based architecture, relying on React for the user interface. Bootstrap CSS styles the application, ensuring responsiveness and visual appeal.

Data fetching is asynchronous, employing React hooks and GraphQL Mutations/Queries for server communication. This setup optimizes performance and user experience.

The project structure emphasizes maintainability and scalability. Components, hooks, and utilities are logically organized, enhancing code readability and collaboration.

## 🤔 What could be done differently<a name="what-could-be-done-differently"></a>

During the development of this Full Stack Test FE, one area where I recognize room for improvement is in enhancing the accessibility and user experience (UX) of the Frontend. While the current implementation focuses on functionality and performance, there's an opportunity to prioritize accessibility features and refine the UX to ensure a seamless and inclusive experience for all users.

In future iterations, I aim to conduct thorough accessibility audits and usability testing to identify areas for improvement. This could involve optimizing keyboard navigation.

By placing a stronger emphasis on accessibility and UX considerations, the Full Stack Test FE can better cater to diverse user needs and adhere to web accessibility standards, ultimately leading to a more inclusive and user-friendly application.
